## Agent-based Modelling
The following two projects were designed while I was taking **[*Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills*](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/)** for the postgraduate certificate on Geographical Information Science (GIS) at University of Leeds.

### Sheep Grazing 
This project is built upon the practicals I undertook throughout the course. 
Information about this project including source code is available **[here](https://github.com/skylight915/AS1_ABM_SheepGrazing)**
