## Agent-based Modelling
The following two projects were designed while I was taking **[*Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills*](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/)** convened by Dr. Andy Turner for the postgraduate certificate on Geographical Information Science (GIS) at University of Leeds.

### Sheep Grazing 
A agent-based model to build agents (e.g. sheep) wandering around and eating material data from the underlying landscape (e.g. pasture) and to display their movement in an animation. The project is under [APACHE LICENSE, VERSION 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and is mainly composed of the following development steps: <br>

1. Setting up sheep in a space and letting them to interact with each other;
2. Reading in environment data (pasture) and get sheep to eat pasture while moving;
3. Randomizing the movement of sheeps;
4. Displaying the model as an animation including a GUI;
5. Initiatlizing the model with data scrapping from othe web.<br>

Information about this project including source code is available **[here](https://github.com/skylight915/AS1_ABM_SheepGrazing)**.

### Calculating Deaths in the 1665 Black Death Outbreak
A code deveveloped to estimate the total death of the Black Death outbreak in 1664 based upon historical records of rats population and parish population density and to allow user inputs. The project is under [APACHE LICENSE, VERSION 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and is mainly composed of the following development steps: <br>
