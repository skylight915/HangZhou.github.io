# HangZhou.github.io
My personal website containing information on my academic training, professional background, research interest and very rudimentary coding experience.  

## List of main files
1. Markdown and HTML documents 'CV', 'Coding', 'Research' & 'Teaching' -- essentially contained in the navigational menu.
2. PDF documents of my CV (Chinese & English)


detailing the intention of the software, issues during development and how these were overcome (or not), general sources used, the thought processes going into the software design, and the software development process followed. 

## Discriptions

## Development ideas
- Include a new webpage on the fieldwork photos I have taken during my research. 

This document is intended to give a brief context for the software, explaining how it ended up how it is, such that any issues can be understood and the work can be assessed appropriately; 

## Development history
The intention is to document changes from one version to another here.
### Origin
This code began its development during the course **[Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/)**. I used the Minimal style avalaible in Github as the main theme of my website. However, as this style does not allow the creation of multiple webpages, I accessed the source code of this style and used html language to set up a navigational bar so as to enable multipage website. When creating these webpages, I wrote markdown document first, used generator available online to translate them into html language, created a html and then copied into it both the html language of my own written content as well as that of the Minimal style.
