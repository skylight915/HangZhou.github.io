# HangZhou.github.io
My personal website containing information on my academic training, professional background, research interest and very rudimentary coding experience.  

## List of main files
1. Markdown and HTML documents 'CV', 'Coding', 'Research' & 'Teaching' -- essentially contained in the navigational menu.
2. PDF documents of my CV (Chinese & English)
3.  PNGs of the logos of Linkedin and Google scholar and of my profile picture.
  
## Development ideas
- Include a new webpage on the fieldwork photos I have taken during my research. 

## Development history
The intention is to document changes from one version to another here.
### Origin
This code began its development during the course **[Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/)**. I used the Minimal style avalaible in Github as the main theme of my website. However, as this style does not allow the creation of multiple webpages, I accessed the source code of this style and used html language to set up a navigational bar so as to enable multipage website. When creating these webpages, I wrote markdown document first, used generator available online to translate them into html language, created a html and then copied into it both the html language of my own written content as well as that of the Minimal style.
