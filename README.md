My personal website containing information on my academic training, professional background, research interest and very rudimentary coding experience.  

## List of main files
1. Markdown and HTML documents 'CV', 'Coding', 'Research' & 'Teaching' -- essentially contained in the navigational menu.
2. PDF documents of my CV (Chinese & English)
3. PNGs of the logos of Linkedin and Google scholar and of my profile picture. 

## Development ideas
- Include a new webpage on the fieldwork photos I have taken during my research. 


## Development history
The intention is to document changes from one version to another here.
### Origin
This code began its development during the course **[Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/)** with many parts of the code provided by the course convener Dr. Andy Turner including the environment data ('in.txt') and webpage for data scrapping.
