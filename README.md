A agent-based model to build agents (e.g. sheep) wandering around and eating material data from the underlying landscape (e.g. pasture) and to display their movement in an animation. 

## List of main files
1. The main source code 'module_practical_final.py'.
2. A module file 'agentframework.py'

## Development ideas
- Include a new webpage on the fieldwork photos I have taken during my research. 


## Development history
The intention is to document changes from one version to another here.
### Origin
This code began its development during the course **[Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/)** with many parts of the code provided by the course convener Dr. Andy Turner including the environment data ('in.txt') and webpage for data scrapping.
