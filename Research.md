This thesis aims to understand the process of building state institutions in Uganda’s roads sector. Through centering on Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), its recent restructuring exercise as well as its historical predecessors in this sector, I seek to illuminate how they were built, restructured and deployed to carry out the core state agenda of road making throughout different periods from the colonial Protectorate and early postcolonial decades to, most importantly, the contemporary context that witnesses an increasingly polycentric development landscape epitomised by China’s ‘South-South’ interactions with Africa. It is based on a one-year ethnographic fieldwork in Uganda, mainly including participant observation in UNRA, and interviews with Chinese construction contractors, in addition to archival research on Public Works Department in the Uganda Protectorate.
