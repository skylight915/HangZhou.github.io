## About me

Welcome & Bienvenue! I am the postdoctoral fellow in ERC-funded project **[Transoceanic Fishers: Multiple mobilities in and out of the South China Sea](https://www.cmi.no/projects/2195-transoceanic-fishers-multiple-mobilities-in-and-out-of-the-south-china-sea)** at Chr. Michelson Institute in Bergen, Norway. My postdoctoral research looks at how local fishing communities and industries in West African countries (Senegal & Guinea Bissau) negotiate with the expansion of long-distant fishing activities.
